==============

Adds a beautiful and customisable MailChimp opt-in bar to the top of your WordPress site. 

_This plugin is under active development and may be subject to changes breaking backwards compatibility._

Installation
------------

Here's a [guide on how to install the plugin in your WordPress site](https://wordpress.org/plugins/mailchimp-top-bar/installation/).
If you want to run the latest development version, you have two options:

* You can download the repository .zip file: [mailchimp-top-bar.zip](https://github.com/ibericode/mailchimp-top-bar/archive/master.zip)
* You can clone the GitHub repository using Git

This will download the latest development version of the MailChimp Top Bar plugin. While this version is usually stable,
it is not recommended for use in a production environment.

Note that this plugin depends on [MailChimp for WordPress](https://mc4wp.com/) to work, so you will need to install that plugin first.
